1) Difference between forEach and for...of
forEach: Runs a callback on each item in an array. Cannot use break or continue. Doesn’t work well with sequential async/await.
for...of: Loops over any iterable. Can use break and continue. Works properly with async/await.
2) Hoisting and the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)
Hoisting: JS moves variable and function declarations to the top of their scope during compilation.
var: Hoisted and initialized with undefined.
let/const: Hoisted but not initialized → TDZ (accessing them before declaration throws an error).
3) Difference between == and ===
==: Compares values with type coercion. Types may be converted before comparison.
===: Compares both value and type. No coercion.
4) How try-catch works & why it’s important in async operations
try block runs code that might throw an error.
catch block handles the error, preventing the program from crashing.
Important for async operations to catch rejected promises or runtime errors.
5) Type conversion vs coercion
Conversion: Explicit and deliberate change of type (predictable).
Coercion: JS automatically converts types (may lead to unexpected results).
